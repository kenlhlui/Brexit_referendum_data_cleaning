# Brexit_referendum_data_cleaning
This is a R data cleaning project that I performed for my econometrics course term project in Sciences Po Paris. I scrapped different voting data soures for the Brexit Referendum in 2016 and cleaned it for further regression.

Please see the raw_files for the data source.
